    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to uncertainties on the exact scheduling time of JWST observations (due, e.g., to previous observations, unforeseen scenarios, etc.), it is recommended users of the observatory consider some flexibility in the start of their observations in order to give some leeway to the observatory scheduling system of about one hour (observers can still choose to narrow this window further, but with a penalty in the charged time to the program). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this time window can be defined in the time-domain in the Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT) under the [APT Special Requirements](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-astronomers-proposal-tool-overview/apt-workflow-articles/apt-special-requirements), for periodic phenomena like transiting exoplanets this would be cumbersome to do as one would have to define a time-window for every possible transit/eclipse event on the current observing Cycle. Fortunately, APT [also allows to define this window in phase-space](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jppom/special-requirements/timing-special-requirements) (i.e., in units of fractions of the orbital period), where the zero-phase can be arbitrarily defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **ExoCTK's phase-constraint package** was developed in order to perform the calculations of these windows in phase-space for any transiting exoplanet out there in a quick-and-easy way. This package, thus, greatly simplifies the work of observation planning when it comes to transiting exoplanet observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Quick start\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we want to obtain the 1-hour-window in phase space to schedule an observation of the primary transit of WASP-18b. To obtain this with **ExoCTK's phase-constraint** package, one would simply do:"

    "Two lines. That's all it took! In addition to the phase-constraints (minimum and maximum phases), the `phase_overlap_constraint` call also returns the parameters it used to calculate the phase-constraint, along with some ephemerides of the planet like, e.g., the period $P = 0.94124$ days and time-of-transit center $t_0=58374.6699$ in Modified Julian Date (MJD, i.e., $JD - 2400000.5$). But how did this magic happen? What do these numbers actually mean? Keep reading to understand how the phase-constraint calculator actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Understanding the phase-constraint calculator for primary eclipses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 How did it do that?\n",
    "In the example above, the phase-constraint calculator returned the minimum and maximum phases for the exoplanet under study given only the planet name and the size of the window we were aiming to. In the background, the phase-constraint package automatically queries the exoplanet properties from [exo.MAST](https://exo.mast.stsci.edu/) given only the planet's name. Using this, it retrieves the properties of interest (period, $P$, and total transit duration, $T_{14}$, in this case) and, by default, assumes the observer wants to start the observations _at the very least_ a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{pre} = 0.75 + \\textrm{MAX}(1, T_{14}/2) + T_{14}/2$ hours\n",
    "\n",
    "_prior to mid-transit_ in this case. This time, by the way, is not arbitrary. Overall, the recommended (e.g., see [this JWST observation planning step-by-step tutorial](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-spectrograph/nirspec-example-science-programs/nirspec-bots-observations-of-wasp-79b/step-by-step-etc-guide-for-nirspec-bots-observations-of-wasp-79b)) time to spend on a target for a transit/eclipse observation is the above time $T_{pre}$ prior to the mid-transit time, and $T_{post} = T_{14}/2 + MAX(1, T_{14}/2) + T_W$ hours _post mid-transit_ where $T_W$ is the phase-constraint window (one hour in our example above). Using the retrieved properties for WASP-18b shown above, we can understand how the calculation was done in the background. The transit duration is $T_{14} = 2.14368$ hours; the period is $P = 0.94124 = 22.58976$ hours. The time $T_{pre}$ is, thus, $T_{pre}\\approx 2.89368$, which in phase-space units is\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{pre}/P \\approx 0.128097$.\n",
    "\n",
    "APT assumes the transit event is always located at phase 1 (or zero, whichever is more comfortable). Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum phase = $1 - T_{pre}/P\\approx 0.871903$,\n",
    "\n",
    "which is exactly the maximum phase retrieved by the calculation. The minimum phase is simply one hour earlier in phase space. This gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum phase = $1 - (T_{pre}+1)/P\\approx 0.827635$,\n",
    "\n",
    "again, exactly the minimum phase quoted above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Modifying phase-constraint parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase-constraint calculator allows to ingest a number of variables into the calculation in order to give control to the user in terms of the calculations they want to make. For instance, the pre-transit duration discussed above, $T_{pre}$, can be changed by the user. This is done using the `pretransit_duration` variable. Suppose we wanted to retrieve the phase-constraint that corresponds to a pre-transit duration of 4 hours instead. We can simply do:\n"

This gives another functionality to the package: a secondary eclipse time calculator. \n",
