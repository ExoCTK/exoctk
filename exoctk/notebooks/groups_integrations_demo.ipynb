    "# Groups and Integrations Calculator Notebook Demo\n",
    "This is a quick demo for the Groups and Integrations Calculator (i.e. the `exoctk.groups_integrations` subpackage). This demo can run with the `exoctk-3.6` `conda` environment and a proper installation of the `exoctk` software package and the `EXOCTK_DATA` data package.  For instructions on how to download and install these things, see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/ExoCTK/exoctk#installation).\n",

    "The Groups and Integrations Calculator was written as an exoplanet-focused alternative to the JWST ETC (also known as `pandeia`). It's power comes from:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using pre-sampled data and interpolating for a speedy calculation. \n",
    "2. Having the power to provide you with the optimal configuration for your observation -- instead of just letting you guess and check configurations. \n",

    "In addition to installing `exoctk`, you'll need the pre-sampled data that the groups and integrations calculator runs on, in a `json` format.  If you followed the installation instructions linked at the top of this notebook, you should have this under the environment variable `EXOCTK_DATA`, and we'll just take it from your `path` -- otherwise you'll need to specify the path in this cell. \n",

    "Also -- **DON'T WORRY** if you get a big scary warning about the `matplotlib` backend. We need that in there to run server side when we host the website -- but it won't affect any of this demo of your general `exoctk` usage. If it's truly too hideous run this cell twice and warning should vanish."

Groups are how many frames you can pack into an integration, and generally this is goverened by how quickly your target will saturate on the detector. With every integration, there is overhead time added into the observation, and less time observing your actual transit. So, once the calculator has figured out the maximum possible groups before the detector is saturated, it will return that number of groups, how many integrations of that pattern it takes to fill up your whole transit time, and some additional helpful parameters like what's the maximum saturation you might reach during this observation, how long the actual scheme will take (since there will be a slightly different rounding when everything is added up), how efficient your observation is, etc. \n",
