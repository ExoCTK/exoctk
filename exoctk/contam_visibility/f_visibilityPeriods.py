"""
Series of functions to compute the visibility periods for a given
(RA, DEC) with in some cases the possibility to select a PA value.

Functions derived from the code of Wayne Kinzel provided by Jeff Valenti
Extract from the e-mail of Wayne Kinzel:
As before, the code is not officially tested, nor is it an official
STScI product. Users should be warned that the apparent position of the
Sun changes ~+/-0.2 degrees epending upon where JWST is in its orbit.
So do not rely strongly on these results if the target is within ~0.2
degrees of |ecliptic latitude| 45 degrees or 85 degrees.
For example if a target is at 84.9 degrees latitude and the tool says it
is CVZ, it may not be with the operational orbit.
